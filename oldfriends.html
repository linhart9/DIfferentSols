        So I stumbled across this song the other day and it was one of the rare ones that makes a huge impact on you the minute you listen to it. So big of an impact that I'm feeling the need to spend time to write this blog about it all. Give it a listen before you read the rest of this if you haven't yet.
        <br>
        <br>
        I really believe that can’t make friends like old friends. Now don’t get me wrong, going away to college and having lived in a few places across the country, I made some amazing friends along the way, friends that I will probably keep in touch with for the rest of my life. You can meet and become great friends with some incredible people in the later years of your life, but I find that there's always something that separates my old friends from my new friends. A type of bond that is created from experiencing the most impactful points of life side by side. From learning to ride bikes together so you could finally be free of your parents grasp and pulling all nighters at sleepovers beating your favorite video games, to being there for each others first girlfriends and entering the rebellious stage of  life together, there are some things that just can't be recreated naturally in a friendship.

        I am unbelievably blessed to still be friends with friends that I made back as far as preschool because I know this isn't the case for everyone. Friends that I am free to be my complete self around. Friends that can call me out on my shit because they aren't afraid to lose me as a friend just because of something they said (and vise versa). Friends that I can distance myself from for a period of time but still be welcomed back with open arms. Friends that would fight people twice their size if they saw them doing me wrong. These are my favorite type of people in life. They feel more like family than friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now I don't wanna get too sappy here but just like family I really do love these humans. We get drunk together and tell eachother we love each other all the time, but that's a big cop out and I'm definitely equally to blame in that respect. You’re never too manly to tell the people you love in life and you love them, so I need to get better at that. Good trustworthy people are the real priceless treasures of this world.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m not gonna say names because you know who you are, but thank you for always being by my side in times of need and I can’t imagine this life without you. I Love you old friends.
