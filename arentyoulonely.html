      <h3> Aren't you lonely? </h3>
      <p>
        One of the most frequent questions I get about living in my Van is something along the lines of “but don’t you just get lonely traveling by yourself?”. If I had to give you a straight for answer, I would easily tell you that no, I’m not lonely. Now do I get lonely at times but who doesn’t? I’m sure anyone reading this gets lonely sitting on the couch of their one-bedroom apartment occasionally, or travels for work and can’t wait to get back to their friends back home. I’d say in general I’m a pretty introverted person so I’m definitely not the type of guy who needs to be out with friends 24/7. When I spend too much time out and about in a social setting I tend to want to go home and recharge my social batteries before heading back out into the world of conversation. Traveling alone allows me to do the things I want to do without having to worry if the rest of the group is on board with the plan. It allows me to eat whatever I want whenever I want without having to compromise on what’s for dinner. It allows me to full concentrate on taking pictures when I’m out and about and not be holding up the hike.

        That being said there are times when I’m out hiking or exploring and I stumble across a moment quite beautiful, that I wish I could share the experience with a good friend or a significant other. When I feel that sense of loneliness coming on, I think back to a quote that I heard a few years ago that went something like “There’s never a good time to do what you want to do”. Basically what I get out of this is that in life there really is never going be a perfect time to go on that trip, switch jobs, fall in love and sometimes you can’t wait around for that perfect instance. Like I said before I would love to have a good friend be my side to experience these things with, but at the same time I’m not gonna wait around for people to be ready to experience the things that I want to experience here and now. I came to this realization when I was planning a trip to Joshua Tree National Park when I was living near San Diego. There was probably 3 or 4 of us who originally planned on going on the trip but after the rest of them ended up not being able to go I debated for awhile if I should go anyways. It wasn’t a good time to do what I wanted but it was the only time that I was gonna have time to so I decided to give it a go. That trip ended up being my first solo backpacking trip and was honestly one of the most unique experiences of my life. A peaceful time with my thoughts and the noises of nature (including some not so peaceful coyotes that kind of scared the shit out of me at the time).

        I’m not out here all alone though, I spend my time bouncing from one place to the next meeting up with old friends and making some new friends along the way as well. It’s pretty surprising but a lot of people wanna spend time with the homeless guy who lives out of his van. My guess is that its makes them feel better about their living situation haha. I get to experience their city or mountain town, grab a drink or 20 with them, and share some quality experiences with them before my social batteries get low and I head back out on the road. If anyone reading this sees me traveling around their area and wants to meet up for a weekend or just to grab a cup of coffee, I am always willing to meet up! Doesn’t matter if we are best of buds or only said hi once or twice.
