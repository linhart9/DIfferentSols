      <h3> 4/5/19: Dumb Stuff Eric Does Ep.1 </h3>
      <p>
        Again, I want to make it clear that the pictures I post of me living in a van are pretty skewed as I really am only taking pictures of the cool moments when in turn there are an a boat load of moments when things are go wrong/I make a huge fool on myself. This series will be collection of those moments.
        <br>
        <br>
        Only a couple weeks into my journey of living in a Van I had one of my most face palming moments. To start off, if it has not already been made clear, my van is not 4wd so there are times (especially on mountain roads) where I need to put chains on in order to safely reach my destination. So I wake up early and am attempting to make my way from Denver to a ski resort called Arapahoe Basin so I can catch first chair. As I approach the base of the pass that will take me over the mountain range to reach the ski resort, I do my normal assessment of the road to see if I will need to put chains on the old girl and the roads seem clear enough that I decide against it in order to save a bit of time and make sure I get to the ski resort as early as possible. At this point in my life I should have learned to just do the opposite of what I think because 90% of the time I’m wrong. Of course I get up about half way only to realize that the roads are worse than I thought (big surprise Eric), so I pull off in a safe spot to put my chains on.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now for those of you who have never put chains on, its about the equivalent in frustration of tossing one of those rings on the milk bottles at the carnival… while your hands are freezing cold. I’ve gotten decent at putting them on over the years but it honestly is still a huge victory when you get them on quickly and efficiently. I open up my back van doors to grab my chains from my “garage” in my van and get to the process. Things go surprisingly smooth and I get them on in record time. I’m totally feeling myself at this point, most likely talking myself up in my head, and just really excited to get to the mountain for first tracks. I hop in the front seat, turn up the Incubus that I most likely have playing on the stereo and hit the road.
        <br>
        <br>
        So about two bends in the road after I put the chains, on some jackass tries to pass me. This is a two lane weavy winding mountain road with no guard rails. This kind pf pissed me off knowing he’s putting us both in danger and then I realize he’s not trying to pass me but it driving along side of me yelling shit at me like I’m driving slowly or something. The audacity of this guy. So he finally passed and I’m thinking this guy has a death wish or is just plain stupid. Big surprise, turns out I’m the stupid one. After feeling a small draft, I turn around to realize I had forgot to fully close my back van doors and I was driving down the road with them half open!
        <br>
        <br>
        At this point I’m looking at my side view mirrors to my belongings just spewing across the road, including my snowboard and camping gear. I basically slam on the breaks without thinking and pull off to the side of the road to grab my stuff as quickly as possible. After gathering up my belongings I walk back to the van only to realize that I pulled off in a horrible spot and my rear wheels have sunk in the snow about 10 feet from the cliffs edge. At this point I know my van doesn’t handle well in snow and am terrified that the Van is going to slip off the cliff, so I decide to get winched out.
        <br>
        <br>
        AAA can get there for nearly 3 hours because of the mountain location I’m in and they literally only need to pull me 5 feet to the left. After waking up early and hoping to get first chair at the ski resort, I rushed and didn’t get on the mountain to 2 PM, lesson learned! Dumb stuff Eric does.
