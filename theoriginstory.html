      <h3> 3/12/19: The Origin Story </h3>
      <p>
      I'm pretty sure my first thoughts of living life on the road came after I did a bit of traveling in Europe after college. I got that cliche thirst for endless travel that most people do after they do a bit of backpacking and started watching a unhealthy amount of travel documentaries and youtube videos. The one thing about my europe travels is that I was mostly traveling to big cities because they were easy to get to by train or bus. I really wanted to see the less touristy country sides and wanted to be able to come and go as I pleased without having to make sure I didn't miss trains or planes. That's when I stumbled across what's known as the Pan American Highway.
      <br>
      <br>
      For those of you who have never heard of this, it's a road, or more a conglomerate of roads, that spans from Alaska all the way to the tip of Argentina (picture below). The route is driveable completely by car except for a small section known as the Darian Gap. This area is pretty interesting and if you want to know why its impassable I suggest reading up on it <a href= "https://expertvagabond.com/darien-gap-photos/" style="color:yellow">here</a>. People would travel in vans or jeeps across all of South America coming and going as they pleased. It seemed like true travel to me, where I could explore at my own pace. The idea of spending a year to travel this mind blowing 20,000 miles became somewhat of a new life goal that I could not get out of my head. I have a tendency to become hyper obsessed with things that really peak my interest and I just had a hard time letting this one go. I would tell friends and family about this dream and I would mostly get weird looks and “Ah yeah, whatever you say Eric”s back as responses but I knew that if I really wanted to do it, I could make it happen.
      <br>
      <br>
      Now as you can see I’m not traveling South America and I don't think I will be anytime soon. I won’t say that I have given up on that dream but taken a bit of a detour while still keeping the idea within reach. It honestly would have been a lot to take on all at once. I don’t speak any latin languages fluently. While I consider myself a very big DIYer (Im a cheap bastard), I’m not the most mechanically inclined when it comes to cars. And honestly I didn't know if I would like living in a car alone, so embarking on a year journey in foreign countries may not have been the wisest decision. Also I had no where near the money I would have needed to fund such a long trip safely. So that leads us to about a year ago where the idea of a much more attainable goal of living in a Van and traveling the US came about. I could still have the freedom of living life on the road and visiting new places while keeping my mothers blood pressuruytd5 at a normal level.
      <br>
      <br>
      I believe it is a good starting point to feel out life on the road and so far it's pretty much how I pictured it being. Things are going well and I’m enjoying living life in a small metal box so at this moment the Pan American Highway is still a goal and a dream, but no one knows what the future will bring and I’m perfectly okay with that.
