          <h3> Recent Updates </h3>
          <p> I have made a few updates to the site as you can see. Feel free to use the navigation bar located on the left had handside of the screen (If the navigation bar appears elsewhere, again bear with me as I figure out compatibility issues). Here is where you can find the pieces I have posted sorted by date uploaded. </p>

      <h3> A Formal Introduction</h2>
        <p> Hi peeps. I just wanted to start off by saying thanks for taking the time to check out this website. If you don't know who I am (although I'm pretty damn confident that the only people looking at this are my family and friends), my names Eric Linhart and I'm pretty much just your average kid in his 20's still trying to figure life out and find what brings me the best balance of happiness. Now I know you may be thinking "Wow, this website looks like shit and appears to have come from the dawn of the internet" and I would completely agree with you! Well let me give an explanation for all of this.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some of you may know I am currently in the process of teaching myself coding for web development and if you didn't, now you do! This little website is my attempt at a project that I can update and learn from as a take a journey through this process. My hopes are that it will keep me focused and driven in my path of self education. As for why this website screams dial up internet, well thats because im building it completely from scratch (sorry for the large text desktop users, I havent figured out how to adjust between mobile and desktop). I'm well aware I could go onto websites such as Wordpress or Squarespace and make a very visually appealing site in a matter of minutes, but learning how to style specialty websites is the knowledge that I'm hoping to gain by doing this. So bear with me here, if all goes well this site will continue to get more and more eye appealing, as well as user friendly, as the months advance. </p>
        <p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h3> What the heck are you gonna be writing about? </h3>
        <p> More than anything this is a project for helping me learn, but at the same time I want to make something that is meaningful to me so that I can stay interested in keeping it updated. For the most part I believe that this site will start off as a blog and grow from there. Full disclaimer here, basically all my classes in college were math and science based and I'm pretty sure I only wrote 3 or 4 papers all throughout college. Basically I'm not the best writer in the world, so bear with me as you ask yourself if my run on sentences will ever end. Here's to hoping that creating this website will improve my vocabulary and writing skills as much as it does my coding ones!
          <br>
          <br> As for the type of content I'll be writing about, I am fortunate enough to be full time traveling across the country in a Sprinter Van so I will try to document interesting stories or maybe people that I hopefully come across. I actually debated on blogging for quite some time though because I have a serious issue with not wanting to sound narcissistic in writing about my own personal adventures and highlights. With today's social media influencers and the skewed views of reality that they put out (where my Fyre Festival Documentary lovers at??), I didn't want to paint a false picture of what I'm doing by just showing beautiful pictures and telling adventurous stories. After talking to some friends about it and hearing that people just want to hear what's going on in my life, I'm deciding to give it a shot. All in all you should be expecting to hear of adventures and times of happiness, while also mixing in the all too real struggles that I face daily of living in a Van with 250,000 miles to its name.</p>

        <h3> What's with the name "Different Sols"? </h3>
        <p> I've always kind of wanted a brand to call my own. And to be completely honest I'm pretty sure its 90% because I just wanted to wear t-shirts that have my logo on them (Here's to hoping that I stay dedicated with this enough to make t-shirts for myself one day). As for the name I actually spent way to long attempting to figure out a name that I thought was interesting, catchy, and actually had some meaning behind it.  Let me know what you think! No hard feelings, just trying to get an audience opinion (by the way if you havent tried to get a domain name, its crazy how nearly every .com is taken).
          <br>
          <br>
          The main reasoning behind the name "Different Sols" comes from without a doubt my favorite quote of all time and one that I feel like I have been trying to incorporate into my life the past couple years as much as possible but with a bit of a twist. The use of the term "Sol" here takes a double meaning as it is latin for "Sun" while I'm also using it as a reference to the idea of an individual's "Soul".</p>
          <p class="quote">
          "The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun." - Christopher McCandless
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't already know this quote is from the book Into The Wild (a book about the lust for adventure and travel among other things), and more specifically written by real life Christopher McCandless in his journal as he traveled and learned about himself. This quote has rang throughout my brain for the past couple years of my life as I find myself at the happiest when I am trying things that I never have done before. While I don't think routines in life are necessarily bad and I believe they can seriously help to accomplish goals that may seem out of reach, I find that my life seems to move a lot faster the farther I fall into routines. More than anything we've all heard that life is short, and I plain and simple just don't want my life to be short. Trying new things, seeing new sites, meeting new people, eating new foods; they all leave behind memories that stick in my brain for recall later, while days of constant routine with no new experiences tend to get lost in my abyss of my head. Maybe it's not that life is moving slower exactly but more that I can remember more of my life, so in turn it seems like I've been alive longer? Maybe this is different for those of you that have great memories but for myself this is not the case. I'm at my happiest when I'm experiencing a completely unique day or that each day has "a new and different sun".
          <br>
          <br>
          This brings me the second meaning of the term "Sol". The experiences I enjoy indulging in involve summiting mountains, snowboarding resorts I never have before, learning new tricks, trying new action sport activities, meeting new friendly individuals, taking new unique pictures, etc, but these are certainly not the case for everybody. I'm not saying you have to travel the world to have new experiences. If you are a foodie maybe trying a new restaurant or food truck is your new experience. If yours a runner maybe changing up you running spots is your new experience. If you're a gamer maybe trying new games or playing with different people is your new experience. The list goes on. Everyone is their own unique soul, and we all enjoy different things, but I don't think that separates us in the longing to have each day be just a tad bit differently from the rest.
          <br>
          <br>
          So there ya have it, "Different Sols". I hope I did a decent job explain it without sounding like I was preaching. Again my last hope is to sound narcissistic here, make it seem like i've figured out the answer to the universe, and tell you how you should live your life. I merely have found something that I have enjoyed latching onto for some time now and its feels good to express it in words. Feel free to reach out to me and tell me if you would actually be interested in hearing some of my new experiences (both good and bad) in the form of this blog. Hopefully one day you can give me feed back directly on this site, but as I said before i'm just starting and still have a enourmous amout to learn. Either way i'll probably continue to write these anyways as a way of expression along side helping me progress in website design.
